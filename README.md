# WRF Setup for Mini PC

**Research title**: Development of Small-Scale WRF "Urban" Model for Educational and Research Purposes
**Author**: Mok Wattanasopon and Alvin C. G. Varquez

## Background
This repository is created as a part of undergraduate Independent Research Project (IRP) of [Global Urban Climatology](https://www.tse.ens.titech.ac.jp/~varquez/en/) laboratory, Institute of Science Tokyo (formerly Tokyo Institute of Technology).

The purpose of this project is to create a small scale environment of [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF) model to simulate various idealized condition, and provide more accessible option of climate simulation study in research institutions.
